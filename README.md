🎓 Student Performance Interactive Dashboard
📌 Project Overview
This project explores the impact of various external factors on student academic performance using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes key columns such as math mark, reading mark, and writing mark, along with socio-demographic features like gender, lunch type, parental education, and race/ethnicity.

The goal was to:

Analyze overall performance and identify trends.

Understand how different factors (like lunch, race, and parental education) influence scores.

Build an interactive dashboard to visualize insights using Excel, Power BI, and PowerPoint for executive summaries.

🛠 Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Data cleaning, new column creation, and preliminary analysis.

Power BI: Data modeling and interactive dashboard creation.

PowerPoint: Summary presentation of findings and recommendations.

🔍 Data Preparation
Data Source: Kaggle (Student Performance Dataset)

Data Cleaning:

Checked for duplicates (none found)

Created new columns:

Average Mark: Mean of Math, Reading, and Writing marks

Outcome:

Fail if Avg < 50

Pass if Avg between 50 and 74

Pass with Distinction if Avg ≥ 75

📈 Key Observations
Lunch Impact: Students with a standard lunch performed better in Math.

Gender Gap: Males scored 5.1% higher than females in Math (not necessarily top performers).

Performance Rate:

Pass rate: 89.7%

Distinctions: 324 students (59% female, 41% male)

Race-Based Trends:

Group E: Highest performing group with an average of 72.75%

Group C: Strong performance and teamwork; only 25 students failed out of 319

✅ Recommendations
Lunch Policy:

Introduce more structured lunch categories.

Lock classes during lunch to encourage healthier eating habits and focus, especially in Math.

Gender-Based Support:

Address potential issues like gender-based violence or discrimination.

Implement school-based support programs and gender-balanced study groups.

"We All Pass" Project:

Extra classes for all students, not just those at risk.

Focus on basic concepts to build foundational understanding.

Introduce performance-based rewards: trips to universities like UKZN, cash prizes, certificates.

Lecturer Workshops:

Regular internal meetings to review racial performance distribution.

Encourage fair assessment practices and diverse group work.
