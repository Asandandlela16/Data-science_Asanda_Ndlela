SALES REPORT IN SOUTH AFRICA

Hi I am Asanda Ndlela , an aspiring Data Scientist and this is one of my entry level projects I have been working on while finishing my final year.This repo contains a beginner-to-intermediate level project where I explore Sales report  data using both Power BI and Excel . The goal is to build dashboards that help visualize and track key sales patterns like discounts, popular products , and category performance.

🧰 Tools Used Power BI Desktop (.pbix) – for building interactive dashboards and visuals.

Excel (.xlsm) – used for creating Pivot-tables and extended visuals.

🔍 What This Project Covers :

Filtering by Province , Type of payment method and Category.

The bulkness of items being sold -used a slicer in Excel and profit-per province.

Trying out Power BI features like drill-downs, slicers, and tables(Did not use DAX in this one)

🧪 What I Learned: How to structure dashboards and highlight key metrics

Basic data modeling in Power BI

How to clean and prepare data for reporting

🚧 Still a Work in Progress I’m still learning both Power BI and Excel/VBA, so this project is meant to show my progress and practice—not a finished product. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome, I understand the impoertance of DAX and the Excel LOOKUP function and I am in the process lof mastering them and soon will doma projects on them .

🏃‍♂️ To Run This Open the .pbix file with Power BI Desktop
