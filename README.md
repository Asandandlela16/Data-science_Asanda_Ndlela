# ðŸ”¥ California Wildfire Visualizations

##  Project Overview
This project explores wildfire data in California to understand the patterns, causes, and impacts of wildfires over time on the communities , economy as a whole. Through data visualization, I was aiming to uncover trends and relationships in wildfire activity and present these insights in a visually compelling way that can be helpful in overseeing future impact of such events.


## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals
- Analyze trends in wildfire frequency and severity over time.
- Identify geographic hotspots for these wildfires.
- Explore the total damage on property.
- Visualize the relationship between fire size, cause, and location.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Property damages
- Fiancial loss per region
- Most common causes of fires 
- Loss distribution
- injuries spread

##  Key Insights
- Human activities caused 38% of these wildifires , lightning being 31% and unknown factors being the other 31% , now this suggests that humans are generally not aware of the fire regulations which is really worrying as Carlifonia boasts a polulation of 39+ Million people;
- Now , looking at the average financial loss by region/location Butte county was the most affected with an average loss of $3290 , while Sonoma County had the least average  financial loss with an average of $1875. When it comes to the total financial loss per region Shanta County was the most affected($38k) followed by Butte County($36K) , which is definitely understandable considering that Butte County only had 1M+ properties damaged while Shanta had 2M+ properties damaged.
- A total of 4000+ injuries were recorded and half of those injuries were caused by human activites , worrying!! Now the injuries spread didn't show any outlier  , suprisingly Mendocino county has the most injuries((687) followed by Shanta County(611) which also makes sense as Mendocino had the most homes/houses destroyed of all the regions also.
