SALES REPORT IN SOUTH AFRICA

Hi I am Asanda Ndlela , an aspiring Data Scientist and this is one of my entry level projects I have been working on while finishing my final year.This repo contains a beginner-to-intermediate level project where I explore Sales report  data using both Power BI and Excel . The goal is to build dashboards that help visualize and track key sales patterns like discounts, popular products , and category performance.

Tools Used Power BI Desktop (.pbix) – for building interactive dashboards and visuals.

Excel (.xlsm) – used for creating Pivot-tables and extended visuals.


What This Project Covers :

Filtering by Province , Type of payment method and Category.

The bulkness of items being sold -used a slicer in Excel and profit-per province.

Trying out Power BI features like drill-downs, slicers, and tables(Did not use DAX in this one)

 What I Learned: How to structure dashboards and highlight key metrics , differenct types of graphs amd how to use each graph for what scenario

Basic data modeling in Power BI

How to clean and prepare data for reporting using Power query.

Still a Work in Progress I’m still learning both Power BI (Advanced DAX) and Excel, so this project is meant to show my progress and practice. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome, I understand the importance of DAX and the Excel LOOKUP function and I am in the process lof mastering them as I am still a beginner but I have learned how to create custom measures , calculated columns and working with dates and soon will do projects on them . In this particular project I noticed some faults that Iam tring to fix like the showing of profit for cancelled and pending orders which rerquires me to dive deep into advanced DAX.

To Run This Open the .pbix file with Power BI Desktop
