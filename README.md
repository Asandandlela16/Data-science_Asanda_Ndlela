📊 Customer Experience Dashboard Project
This repo contains a beginner-to-intermediate level project where I explore customer experience data using Power BI and Excel with VBA. The goal is to build dashboards that help visualize and track key customer service metrics like satisfaction scores, feedback trends, and resolution performance.

🧰 Tools Used
Power BI Desktop (.pbix) – for building interactive dashboards and visuals.

Excel (.xlsm) – used for creating macro-enabled reports with basic automation.
