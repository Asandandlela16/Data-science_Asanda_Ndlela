CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PROJECT

In this beginner-to-intermediate level project, customer experience data is explored using Power BI and Excel. The aim is to develop dashboards for visualizing and tracking key customer service metrics, such as satisfaction scores, feedback trends, and resolution performance.

TOOLS THAT I USED:
Power BI Desktop (.pbix) – to build interactive dashboards and visuals.

Excel (.xlsm) – report creating macros and simple automation.

FILES IN THE REPOSITORY:
-Customer Experience Report.pbix
-A Power BI dashboard with slicers, and trend visuals to analyze customer feedback over time.

Customer_Experience_Dashboard1.xlsm
An Excel workbook that includes some basic reporting and macro features (like auto-refresh, button clicks for filters, etc.).

WHAT THE PROJECT COVERS:
Visualization of NPS (Net Promoter Score) and CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) trends

Filtering by region, channel, and time period

Macro buttons in Excel to automate filtering or updating views

Trying out Power BI features like drill-downs, slicers, and tables

WHAT I LEAENED :
How to structure dashboards and highlight key metrics

Basic data modeling in Power BI

How to clean and prepare data for reporting

 Still a Work in Progress
I’m still learning both Power BI and Excel, so this project is meant to show my progress and practicE. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
